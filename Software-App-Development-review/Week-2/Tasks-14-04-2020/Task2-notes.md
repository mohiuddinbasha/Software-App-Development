    I have ensured that python and pip are installed successfully and checked the version of python and pip in command line

    Downloaded the project 1 file and followed the steps provided in the project 1 site under the Python and Flask section

    Successfully installed python packages like Flask, Flask_Session and SQLAlchemy

    I set the environment variable FLASK_APP to application.py

    I set the environment variable DATABASE_URL to Heroku-PostgreSQL-URI

    I got some error after running "flask run" so I resolved the issue with the help from the stackoverflow website

    Finally got the ouput "Project 1: TODO" by the running http://127.0.0.1:5000/
